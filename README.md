# STLinATL 2023

Workshop for the [STLinATL](https://stlinatl.com/) conference, March 13-14, 2023.

## Workshop:  Math and Physics with Video Games

### Description

A significant component of today’s STEM education is coding. By integrating coding with math and science instruction, students learn to use code to do calculations, solve problems, test ideas, and model complex phenomena. Video games offer a rich context in which students can apply math and physics, integrate coding, and explore “worlds” in a way that taps curiosity and interest. In this workshop, participants:  (1) will use a Google Colab notebook to calculate probabilities for a game; (2) will add a few lines of code to create a lunar lander game (like the old Atari version from 1979); and (3) will analyze the math and physics of Angry Birds.  Many other games and activities that you can “play with” outside the workshop will be provided.


## Workhop:  TeachGPT – Connecting Math and Science Learning Activities to AI

### Description

ChatGPT is all the rage. ChatGPT can give you a wonderful list of how ML is used in science, including biology and medicine, astronomy, environmental science, chemistry, and physics. But it doesn’t give you a practical guide. That’s what this workshop is for. We’ll call it TeachGPT -- the math behind ChatGPT and how AI can be used in teaching and learning STEM. In this workshop, participants:  (1) will explore machine learning (ML) algorithms to implement simple examples of text and image classification; (2) will examine ML-related math topics; and (3) will walk through an activity using ML to classify images of galaxies.
